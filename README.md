Hello! This is a puts what you currently listening to on spotify in your Rec Room bio!

It is not coded very well and is just generally not how i wanted it, HOWEVER i have enjoyed making it.

How to run:
    
    Download latest release, unzip and run the .exe file!
    You may be prompted to login into spotify in a browser window, Do so
    Follow the instuctions in the console window

Thanks to betterthenyou#8490 for making the icon!

if you have any issues/need help, Message me: LameLexi#7004


(doesnt work currently, you can if you really want to use it message me your spotify name and ill add you to the app but it gotta request an extension(which can take upto 6 weeks) for poeple to like actually be able to use it)
